# Population genetics of United States' *Empidonax traillii* populations

This project will be based on the data publidshed by Ruegg et. al, 2018.
They used Rad loci for analyses of landscape genomics and climate change vulnearability, but aside form FST values, no population genetics anlyses were done.
The data set has a large geogrpahic reprentation and sample numbers making it ideal for population genetics and phylogeography.
